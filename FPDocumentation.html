            <p> This project was inspired by the cold winter air that leads me to wearing gloves. But these gloves are not compatible with my phone so I can't take pictures of any beautiful scenery I may come across. 
                A fix for this is voice activated pictures where I don't need to press any buttons with my thick gloves. <br>
            </p>
        <h3>Iteration 1</h3>
        <p>I started by measuring the distances between the iPhones' photo button, it's rotate button and where my two servo motors would go. I then designed a case to hold my phone and the two servos. I also created little pieces to attach to these servos which held screw in fiber mesh tips. <br> In the video below, I trained my microphone device and designed my code so that if I said the word "Photo" it would cause one servo motor to spin and if I said the word "Rotate" it would cause the other servo motor to spin </p>

        <p>After implementing my phone into my projects case, the voice activation and motors worked but the fiber mesh tips making contact with the iPhones buttons did not register as a change in conductivity and my project couldn't take photos.</p>
        <h3>Iteration 2</h3>
            <p>For the next and final iteration, I used a stronger motor that pressed the volume buttons on the side of the phone to take a picture, meaning no capacitance would be required. The power comes from a portable charger that connects to my ardunio uno.</p>
