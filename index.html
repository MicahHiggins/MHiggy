    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a Creative Tech and Design major hoping to create video games. I am really into storytelling in general and am also doing a cinema studies minor. Movies, TV shows, and video games are beloved by me and I rate everything I watch out of 10. I also love playing basketball and watching sports. </p>
