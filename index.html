        <h2 id="AM">About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Creative Tech and Design major hoping to create video games. I am really into storytelling in general and am also doing a cinema studies minor. Movies, TV shows, and video games are beloved by me and I rate everything I watch out of 10. I also love playing basketball and watching sports. I try to get 20,000 steps every day to keep up my physical health.
            If I had to choose between eating a cheeseburger or climbing on top of a car and yelling "ahoy this vehicle be mine for all ye days!" I would choose eating a cheeseburger. I have never taken any drugs or broken any bones and Ive got a suspicion that if I take drugs for the first time, I'm also going to somehow break a bone for the first time. My favorite movie is Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring. The LoTR books are godly too.
